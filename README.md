# Intro to Closures: A live lesson with @fromJrToSr and @UnderdogDevs

I ([Fernando](https://twitter.com/fromjrtosr)) wrote this class for UnderdogDevs! ([@UnderdogDevs](https://twitter.com/UnderdogDevs)) are a group of software developers supporting the formerly incarcerated & disadvantaged in their transition into the software industry.

In order to get more exposure and help members of the iOS community, I've been working on teaching materials that can be freely made available and help explain complex concepts in simple ways. This talk gives a brief introduction to one of the foundational concepts of Swift: closures.

The talk, and the keynote slides, will take place January 27 @ 7pm central US and will be recorded and posted here.

In the meantime, the material contains two playgrounds that act as workbooks. Start with `Transform-Elements-Starter.swift`. Then continue with `Escaping-Closures`.
